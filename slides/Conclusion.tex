\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{Requirements}{}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The program should automatically generate, and update, the ground handlers’ schedules,
as mentioned in section 4.5
\item The program has to take into account that some tasks cannot be performed simultaneously,
as described in section 2.2.9
\item To minimize flight delays, the program has to be able to communicate the ground handlers’
jobs to them, and directly notify them of changes, as described in section 4.5
\item The program has to be able to create teams dynamically, as described in section 3.1.2
\item The supervisors’ should get the information about the performance reports automatically
and courses of action should be recommended, as described in section 4.4.2
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem formulation}{}
	How would it be possible to create a
	software solution that takes the different needs of the ground handlers into account, such as
	accounting for delays, by dynamically adapting their schedules to unplanned situations?
