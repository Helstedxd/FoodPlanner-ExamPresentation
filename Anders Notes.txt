In this semester we have worked whith the problem that is foodwaste and we have tried to create an software solution that will help reduce the amount of foodvaste in private homes.
In this presentation we would like to trough 6 topics:
*Problem Statement - In here the sources of which information have been gathreded from will be mentioned and the requiremnets for the system will be listed
*XAML - The reasons for why WPF have been choosen wll be explained and some examples of how the XAML have been used will be shown
*Code Exammples - The interesting code from the projetc will be presented
*Unit Testing - Result from a unit test on the system
*Usability Test - An summarizing and debate of the test will be made
*Reflection - The thought on how the system and project could be improved will be presented in the this last topic

We will start out with the Problem statement.
the problem statemens says "How can a software system assist the consumer in planning and managing a meal plan
to minimize food waste and simultaneously be flexible enough to support their planning, shopping and cooking habits?"
We have tried to create an software solutin which would solve or help to solve these problems
-Planning and managing meals
-Minimizing food waste
While solving these problems we would like the solution to consider cooking habbits in the form that users have different prefernces in form of taste and products they may or may not consume. 

The greatest source of information in form of quality and volume(quantity?) have been from the interviews we conducted and the the reports we had collected. THe questions used in the interview was structured which allowed us to get data that was comparable. There was another set of intervies which we used, but these were not conducted by ourselves. They were found in the other reports we used.



After we finished the projects, 3 errors have been found in the program. 2 of them are related to miscalculations when the program has to work with quanities of food items. 

1. The method removePassedMeals will remove ingredients from the inventory when the meal is schedueled to the day prior to the current date, as to simulate the meal being cooked and thefore the ingredients that te recipe needs, have been used. The needed ingredients from a recipe will be multiplied if more people are dinning together and this is taken into consideration when the shopping list i screated. But when the ingredients are removed from the inventory this information is not taken into account which means that the ingredients removed is not represental of the ingridients used.

PublicQuerys.cs http://puu.sh/f0Gud/9c9c8f3d67.png Problem: Ligesom den føste kode tager denne del ikke højde for antal person er i hustanden når den sortere, den tager udgangspunkt i 1 opskrift

3. When the program loads the mealplan where the user can see the sceduled meals, all meals in the database is loaded for the week the user is currently looking at. This means that if a user logs in on another account he/she will still see the same meals. This can be corrected by only showing meals releavnt to the currently logged in user.

MealPlanViewModel.cs http://puu.sh/f0Ff3/dfa5d003b7.png Problem: Koden tager ikke højde for hvilken person der er logget ind i programmet, og dermed loader ALLE Meals, uanset hvem der har lagt dem ind
